## cseekers Mission
- scan address range in local network to detect reachable devices<br>
- optional port scan config for live hosts to work faster and more efficient<br>
- displays a message when a port is open which is usually vulnerable<br>
- store succeed results to a file for saving a detailed summary<br>

## :rocket: Getting Started: 

1 ) Make sure, you have `Java` installed:
```
java -version
```
2 ) If it isn't installed (Debian/-based):
```
sudo apt-get install openjdk-18-jdk
```
3 ) Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Keyj33k/cseek-ClientIdentifier-Java.git
```
4 ) `Run cseek` using the following command:
```
java -jar cseek.jar
```

## Options/Usage
```
syntax: 	 java -jar cseek.jar <ipv4Addr(First Three Octets Only)> <minHost> <maxHost> disable
		 java -jar cseek.jar <ipv4Addr(First Three Octets Only)> <minHost> <maxHost> enable <minPort> <maxPort>

examples:	 java -jar cseek.jar 192.168.2 1 5 disable
				      or
		 java -jar cseek.jar 192.168.2 1 10 enable 50 60
```

## My Motivation
In most cases I used a simple bash script to start the recon session to learn about the network of the <br> 
current pentest. It's a really good method to getting started, but for bigger ranges it's nearly <br> 
impossible to keep the overview. If the Bash script located active devices, I had to do a port scan on <br> 
each hosts separately. While this process, the workspace looked very messy and the overview was lost quickly. <br> 
In a nutshell, I wanted to create a tool that would do all these things itself and simply save all active <br> 
devices and their associated open ports to one file. If cseek stored the results, I know where i need to begin <br>
my next steps without loosing much time and keep a clear workspace too.
